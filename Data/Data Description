The data-set comprises transactions made in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. This data-set shows the two-day transactions where 492 of 284,807 transactions were fraudulent. The data-set is highly imbalanced, with the positive category (fraud) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.
Numerical variables resulting from PCA transformation are in the data-set. However, due to data privacy issues, the original features and more background information are not available. V1, V2...V28 are the key PCA components collected. The only features not transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount.' The 'Time' feature includes the seconds from the first transaction in the data-set. The 'Amount' feature is the payment amount used for cost-sensitive learning. 'Class' is the response parameter, and in case of fraud, it takes value 1 and 0 otherwise.
